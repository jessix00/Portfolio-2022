        <p>
          I'm a UI/UX Designer and Frontend Web Developer living in Phoenix, AZ. I come from a diverse background but I've always been interested in design and technology. I've been involved in the arts from an early age and I enjoy expressing myself through digital photography and graphic design. As a Web Developer, I've built websites for full-service digital promotions, rebates and loyalty programs. Some of the brands I've worked with include Miller Coors, McDonalds, Pepsi, General Mills, Lowe's, Starbucks, Amex, Hershey's and Amazon to name a few.
          When it comes to work, I want to be involved in projects I find challenging with people that inspire me.
